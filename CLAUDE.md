# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`dev-term` is a modular, extensible development terminal for talking to devices over serial, TCP,
and (eventually) other transports — decoding/presenting whatever comes back and sending commands.
Built on .NET 10. Full design intent lives in [`docs/design/`](docs/design/README.md); this file
covers only what's actually built and the conventions that matter for working in this codebase.

## Commands

```bash
dotnet build                          # whole solution (DevTerm.slnx)
dotnet test                           # whole solution — currently fast (well under a second per project)
dotnet test tests/DevTerm.Core.Tests  # one project
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AsciiPresenterTests"   # one class, any project
dotnet run --project src/DevTerm.Console -- --listports true    # list serial ports
dotnet run --project src/DevTerm.Console -- --transport serial --port COM3 --presenter ascii --lineending Cr
```

There is no separate lint step; `dotnet build` surfaces analyzer warnings (MSTest analyzers included).

A personal, untracked `appsettings.Local.json` next to `DevTerm.Console`'s output (copied there on
build if present in `src/DevTerm.Console/`) holds a saved connection profile, so `dotnet run
--project src/DevTerm.Console` with **no arguments** connects using whatever's saved there — see
"Configuration" below. `src/DevTerm.Console/Properties/launchSettings.json` has named profiles for
real devices used during development (IDE "Debug" dropdown, or `dotnet run --launch-profile "<name>"`).

## Architecture

**Core abstractions** (`DevTerm.Core`): `ITransport` (byte-stream connection lifecycle + I/O),
`IPresenter` (bytes → zero or more rendered strings — see "Presenters" below), `Session` (binds one
transport to a `Pipeline` of presenters), `Pipeline` (fans a byte chunk out to every presenter and
flattens their outputs into `PresenterOutput`s). Everything is resolved through DI
(`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`) — nothing `new`s up a transport or presenter directly;
each plugin-ish project exposes an `AddXyz(IServiceCollection)` extension.

**Project layout**:
- `DevTerm.Core` — the abstractions above, plus `AddDevTermCore()`.
- `DevTerm.Transports.Serial` / `DevTerm.Transports.Tcp` — `ITransport` implementations. Each is
  independently testable via a fake stream (see "Testing" below), never real hardware/sockets.
- `DevTerm.Presenters.Text` — ASCII (line-buffered), UTF-8, hex, decimal, octal, binary.
- `DevTerm.Console` — the CLI front end (`Host.CreateDefaultBuilder` + DI, wires the chosen
  transport/presenter from configuration).
- `DevTerm.Configuration` — shared front-end bootstrapping (CLI options, config layering) meant to
  be reused by every front end, not just the console app — see TODO.md for current status; this is
  actively being split out of `DevTerm.Console` as TUI/WPF front ends are added.

**Read path**: transports read via `System.IO.Pipelines` (`ITransport.Input` is a `PipeReader`) —
a shared `StreamToPipePump` (`DevTerm.Core.Transports`) pumps a `Stream` into a `PipeWriter`'s
pooled buffers, avoiding a per-chunk array allocation. `Session` runs its own pull loop
(`PipeReader.ReadAsync`/`AdvanceTo`) rather than an event-based push model.

**Presenters return a list, not a single string** (`IReadOnlyList<string> Render(ReadOnlySequence<byte>)`):
a presenter can buffer internally and emit nothing until it has something complete (the ASCII
presenter buffers until a line terminator or a max length), or several items if more than one
boundary arrived in one read. `Pipeline.Render` flattens this into zero or more `PresenterOutput`s.

**Configuration**: every configurable component uses the Options pattern
(`Microsoft.Extensions.Options`) — a component takes `IOptions<TOptions>` directly in its
constructor (not a primitive parameter + factory lambda), so a plain
`services.AddSingleton<TInterface, TImpl>()` resolves it correctly. `DevTermConfiguration`
(currently in `DevTerm.Console`, moving to `DevTerm.Configuration`) layers config sources:
`appsettings.json` → `appsettings.<environment>.json` → `appsettings.Local.json` (untracked,
per-machine profile) → environment variables (`DEVTERM_` prefix) → command-line args (highest
precedence) — via the standard `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` extensions, not a hand-rolled
parser. `CliOptions` property names double as CLI flag names (case-insensitive).

Full architecture/rationale, including what's designed but not yet built (dynamic plugin loading,
protocol decoders, rendering presenters, device control modules, RFC 2217, UDP/HID/BLE transports,
TUI, WPF): see [`docs/design/`](docs/design/README.md). Current backlog/in-progress state:
[`TODO.md`](TODO.md). Daily change log: `docs/changes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## Non-obvious constraints worth knowing before touching related code

- **Moq/Castle cannot mock a method taking `Span<T>`/`ReadOnlySpan<T>`** (a ref struct can't back
  a mocked generic parameter). Interface members meant to be mockable use `ReadOnlyMemory<T>` or
  `ReadOnlySequence<T>` instead, converting to `.Span` only inside the implementation.
- **`SerialPort.BaseStream.ReadAsync(Memory<byte>, CancellationToken)` does not reliably honor
  cancellation** on real hardware (verified, not theoretical) — `DevTerm.Transports.Serial` reads
  via the `SerialPort.DataReceived` event instead (a cancelable `TaskCompletionSource`, not a
  polling loop). Don't reintroduce a direct `ReadAsync`/`Task.Run`-wrapped-sync-`Read` on
  `SerialPort` without re-verifying against real hardware — both were tried and both had real
  cancellation/lifetime hazards.
- **`SerialPort` defaults `DtrEnable`/`RtsEnable` to `false`**, unlike most terminal tools (and
  pyserial) — plenty of devices stay silent without DTR asserted. dev-term defaults both to `true`.
- **`Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.CommandLine` has no bare-boolean-flag support** — a
  standalone `--listen` is not a valid boolean `true`; it must be `--listen true`.
- Verify against real hardware before trusting a fix, when hardware is available — several bugs in
  this codebase (the two above) were only caught by testing against an actual serial device, not
  by unit tests alone. `docs/changes/` records what was verified this way.
