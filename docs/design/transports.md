# Transport Layer

## Purpose

Defines the `ITransport` contract and the initial set of transport plugins.

## Contract responsibilities

- **Discovery** — enumerate available endpoints where the platform supports it (e.g., list serial ports, list paired BLE devices, list HID devices).
- **Configuration** — transport-specific settings (baud/parity/stop bits for serial; host/port for TCP/UDP; VID/PID/usage page for HID; service/characteristic UUIDs for BLE), validated before open.
- **Lifecycle** — open, close, and connection-state notification (connected/disconnected/error), including unexpected disconnects (e.g., USB unplug).
- **I/O** — async byte-stream read and write. Transports that are inherently message-oriented (UDP datagrams, BLE characteristic notifications, HID reports) preserve message boundaries for presenters that care about them, rather than flattening everything into one undifferentiated byte stream.

## Initial transports

### Serial / UART

The most common case for embedded dev boards. Config: port, baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits, flow control. Discovery via platform-native serial enumeration.

### TCP

Supports both directions from day one, since either the device or dev-term may be the one that connects:

- **Client mode** — connect out to a host:port (the common case: a device exposing a TCP server).
- **Listener mode** — bind and accept incoming connections on a local port, for devices that connect out to dev-term (e.g., a board acting as a TCP client). A listener session represents "waiting for a peer"; once a peer connects, the session behaves like any other connected transport for read/write. Needs a policy for what happens with more than one simultaneous inbound connection (e.g., one active peer at a time vs. one session per accepted connection).

Which mode a given session uses is a configuration choice (see the Options pattern in [platform.md](platform.md)), not two different transport plugins.

### UDP

Datagram-oriented; no connection lifecycle in the traditional sense, but still modeled as open/close for consistency with other transports. Also supports both directions:

- **Target mode** — send datagrams to a fixed host:port (and receive any replies from that same peer).
- **Listener mode** — bind a local port to receive datagrams from any sender, useful for devices that push telemetry/broadcast data unprompted. A bound listener can still send (e.g., reply to whichever peer last sent data, or to a separately configured target), since UDP has no inherent client/server asymmetry.

Because UDP preserves datagram boundaries, each received datagram is delivered to the presenter pipeline as one discrete message rather than merged into an undifferentiated byte stream (see [architecture.md](architecture.md)).

### USB HID

Report-based I/O against a specific VID/PID (and usage page/usage where needed) — useful for devices that expose a HID interface for control/debug rather than a serial port.

### BLE

Connect to a peripheral by address/name, then read/write/subscribe to specific GATT characteristics. Platform BLE stack differences (Windows/macOS/Linux) make this likely the hardest transport to keep fully uniform cross-platform.

## Extensibility

New transports (CAN bus, SPI/I2C bridge adapters, raw sockets, SSH, named pipes, etc.) implement the same `ITransport` contract and are picked up via the plugin host — no core changes required.

## Open questions

- How much platform-specific BLE/HID capability can realistically stay uniform across Windows/macOS/Linux vs. needing per-platform plugin variants.
- Reconnect/retry policy: a core concern, or left to each transport plugin?
- How a TCP/UDP listener's "accept a peer" moment maps onto the `Session` model — does accepting a connection create a new session automatically, or does the user's already-open listener session just start flowing data once a peer shows up?
- Policy for multiple simultaneous inbound TCP connections to one listener (reject additional peers vs. one session per accepted connection).
