# TODO

Active / in-progress work for dev-term. Not-yet-started backlog and research work moved out to
[`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) (2026-09-16) to keep this file to what's actually being worked on.
Completed work is logged by date under `docs/changes/`.

## In progress

### Binary layout formats

- `.ksy` reference for binary layouts via [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/) — see the new section
  in `docs/design/device-control-modules.md`. Not started.

### UI batch (started 2026-09-25)

Built on `dev/error-handling-and-todo`, with parallel work in separate git worktrees that are merged and
verified one at a time. Each item is deleted from this file once its detail has landed in `docs/changes/`.

- **Multiple sessions per window** (queued last, since it restructures both main windows; from the TUI/WPF
  main-window specs' Open items). Presenters stopped being the blocker on 2026-09-25, since they're
  per-session now. Nothing builds the UI for it yet.

## Backlog / research

Not-yet-started work, prioritization notes, and early-stage research now live in
[`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md), including the design-level items from the Architect's 2026-09-23 notes.
